Sometimes the names of the libs will be a bit clumsy to use in the program.
For example, with the math library, you'll have to spell 'math.xxx()' all the time.

To ease things up you can alias the name of the function and use that alias through the program:
    Let's use the math library as an example.
    - import math as m
    - m.sqrt(25)

And done, much easier.
