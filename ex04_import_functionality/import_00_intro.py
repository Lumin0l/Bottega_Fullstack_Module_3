'''
We have been working with the core python library (mostly).
Within this core library there are some functions such as .format(), .range()...
If we wanted extra functions, like specialized functions for using math (decimal, floor...) we need to import them to our system.
Some of them, like the math library we have mentioned are included inside the core package, but others are third party libraries.

For those we have the "Python Package Index" or PyPI, also called "the cheese shop".

Inside of it we will have a large number of specialized libraries with functions:
    - Data Science
    - Flask
    - Django
    - ...

To access them we need a connector, we are going to use "PIP" for that. It will allow us install those libraries into our system and let us use them,
