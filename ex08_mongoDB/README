<h1>Attention: differences with course</h1>

<p>In my pc, instead of running the mongo daemon with "mongod" I need to use "mongosh" - as for mongo-shell, I guess. Then the commands shown in the guides work.</p>

<p>Some usefull commands to start or close the mongo daemon:
	- Start the daemon: 		sudo systemctl start mongod
	- Reload the daemon: 		sudo systemctl daemon-reload
	- Verify that it has started:	sudo systemctl status mongod
	- Stop mongodb:			sudo systemctl stop mongod
	- Restart a Mongod process:	sudo systemctl restart mongod</p>

<p>For some reason I get an error when I try to use it as default, need to run these commands first
	- sudo chown -R mongodb:mongodb /var/lib/mongodb
	- sudo chown mongodb:mongodb /tmp/mongodb-27017.sock
	- sudo service mongod restart</p>
